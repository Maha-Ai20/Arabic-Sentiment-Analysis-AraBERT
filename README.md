#  Arabic Sentiment Analysis using AraBERT

##  Project Overview
An end-to-end NLP project developed to analyze and classify sentiments in Arabic tweets, specifically focusing on the Saudi Dialect. The model classifies text into Positive or Negative categories.

##  Technical Highlights
* Preprocessing: Custom pipeline to handle Arabic noise (diacritics, punctuation, URLs) and normalize Saudi dialect.
* Model: Used AraBERT (Transformer-based) via the Hugging Face library for deep linguistic understanding.
* Results: Successfully processed 10,000+ tweets and visualized the results using Matplotlib.

## Tools & Technologies
* Language: Python
* Frameworks: Transformers (Hugging Face), PyTorch
* Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

##  Sample Result
*The project features a balanced visualization showing the distribution of sentiments in the analyzed dataset.*
